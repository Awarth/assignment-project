        Hello! I am Adarsh Tiwari, a passionate web developer with a background
        in computer applications. I hold a Bachelor of Computer Applications
        (BCA) from Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gorakhpur University.
        <br />
        <br /> My journey in web development began during my college days, where
        I worked on various projects that sparked my interest in creating
        dynamic and user-friendly websites. Notable among these are a pizza
        ordering website and a news article platform, both of which allowed me
        to refine my development skills and gain practical experience.
        <br />
        <br /> I am driven by a love for problem-solving and a desire to build
        efficient, aesthetically pleasing web solutions. I find joy in the
        process of turning ideas into reality through code, and I am always
        eager to learn and adapt to new technologies.
        <br />
        <br /> Looking ahead, I aim to continue growing as a full-stack
        developer, taking on challenging projects that push the boundaries of my
        knowledge. My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills to contribute to
        innovative tech solutions that make a meaningful impact.
